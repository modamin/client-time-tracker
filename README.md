# App Builder Template

A React + TypeScript + Vite template for in-session mini-apps built by an AI agent inside the App
Builder. It ships **shadcn/ui (new-york, Radix)** + **Tailwind CSS v4** and a small, familiar set of
libraries — no heavy state/form/validation frameworks — so an agent can build a polished app fast and with
few surprises.

## Stack

- **React 19** + **TypeScript** + **Vite 7** (run with **bun**)
- **shadcn/ui** (`new-york`) on **Radix** primitives (the unified `radix-ui` package)
- **Tailwind CSS v4** (CSS-first, no JS config — tokens live in `src/index.css`)
- **react-router-dom 7** for routing
- **TanStack Query 5** for async data, **TanStack Table 8** for grids
- **zustand** for global state (only when needed; `useState` for local)
- **recharts** for charts, **@dnd-kit** for drag & drop, **lucide-react** for icons, **sonner** for toasts
- **html2canvas-pro 2.4.2 + jsPDF 4.2.1** for bounded Canvas-style PDF capture of an app-owned screen or container, including modern CSS colors and a small backdrop bleed that preserves rounded edges and shadows (`unpdf` remains the existing-PDF extraction tool); the shared button bounds connector-neutral follow-up callbacks so a stalled save cannot wedge export
- **@microsoft/managed-apps** — the connector runtime for an app that carries a
  data-source binding (Dataverse, SharePoint, Excel, Office 365, SQL, …)

## Scripts

| Script | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `bun run check` | Type-check (`tsc`) + Vite build dry-run + ESLint — the required gate before commit |
| `bun run typecheck` | Type-check only (`tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit`) — the cheap gate the app-builder agent runs before hand-back |
| `bun run lint` | ESLint only |
| `bun run dev` | Vite dev server (managed externally by the runtime — do not run by hand) |
| `bun run build` | Production build (`vite build`) — no type-check |
| `bun run preview` | Preview a production build |

## Project layout

```
src/
  App.tsx        routes + providers
  main.tsx       entry point
  index.css      Tailwind + design tokens (oklch)
  routes.tsx     route + nav manifest (add a page here)
  components/    app-shell, PDF target export button, error-boundary, confirm-dialog, states, page-section + ui/ (shadcn, pre-installed)
  hooks/         reusable hooks (use-mobile, use-confirm)
  lib/           cn(), query-client, PDF Blob helper, store (zustand), safe-url, console capture, Cowork parent transport
  pages/         route-level screens (home, not-found)
  types/         fixed parent-frame message contract
generated/       typed connector client, present only when the app carries a binding (do not edit)
```

Path alias: `@/` → `src/`.

## Agent instructions

The build/iterate rules an agent needs at the per-app level — stack conventions, the Tailwind v4
cheat-sheet, structure, and the on-demand feature sections — live in **[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)**, with the
OKLCH presets in its sibling **[THEMING.md](./THEMING.md)** (read on a turn-1 build or recolor/restyle). The file
format is agent-agnostic — any coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, …) reads these, and there is
intentionally no `CLAUDE.md`. Within the App Builder, the subagent that builds and iterates apps is
additionally governed by its own always-loaded operating rules — the verification loop and the full "what
not to touch" ban list — which are enforced there and deliberately **not** duplicated into this `AGENTS.md`
(so this per-app file is intentionally not a self-sufficient contract for an external agent running outside
the harness).

## Live data

An app that carries a data-source binding has its typed client in `generated/` and its
connection reference in `ms.config.json`; the app-data-connectivity skill governs how the agent
consumes them. Both are managed only by the runtime's typed `appbuilder-DataSourceAdd`,
`appbuilder-DataSourceRefresh` and `appbuilder-DataSourceRemove` tools (a connector's actions, or one
table of any tabular connector — SharePoint list, SQL table, Dataverse table; only a SQL stored
procedure as a data source is not offered) — never by a command in this image or by hand. For a source the app is not bound to and cannot bind, the agent builds with realistic
sample data, identifies the affected dataset or entity as sample-backed in authoring chat only, and adds no sample/demo/mock/test-data provenance copy or UI treatment to the app.

## Notes

- This template is **in-memory by default** — a refresh resets app state.
- `node_modules/` is baked into the orchestrator image and bind-mounted read-only; dependencies are not
  installed or patched per session.
